Online Process Servers:

    These are connected to the Process Center and you can see their status in the Servers tab.
    You can choose a snapshot in the Process Center and deploy it directly to these servers while they are online.

Offline Process Servers:

    These servers are defined in the Process Center but are not connected or communicating with it.
    To deploy to these servers, you create a deployment package, transfer it to the target machine, and deploy it using command-line (wsadmin) commands.
