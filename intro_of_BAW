In IBM Business Automation Workflow (BAW), the three-cluster topology is a way to organize and manage different types of workloads and services by grouping them into separate clusters. This helps improve scalability, performance, and maintainability. The three clusters are:

    Application Cluster (AppCluster)
    Messaging Cluster (MECluster)
    Support Cluster (SupCluster)
How It Works

Each cluster is designed to handle specific types of tasks or services within the IBM BAW environment. Hereâ€™s an overview of each cluster and its role:
1. Application Cluster (AppCluster)

    Capabilities: Application
    Databases: ProcessServerDb, IcnDb, SharedDb, TosDb, DosDb
    Components: e.g., ProcessPortal
    Usage: This cluster handles the main application workloads, including process execution, document management, and shared services.

2. Messaging Cluster (MECluster)

    Capabilities: Messaging
    Databases: SharedDb
    Usage: This cluster is responsible for handling messaging services within the IBM BAW environment. It includes databases that support messaging capabilities,
    ensuring reliable communication between different components and services.

3. Support Cluster (SupCluster)

    Capabilities: Support
    Databases: PerformanceDb
    Usage: This cluster is used for support-related services, such as performance monitoring and management. It typically includes the Performance Data
    Warehouse (PDW) database for storing performance metrics and analysis data.

Online Process Servers:

    These are connected to the Process Center and you can see their status in the Servers tab.
    You can choose a snapshot in the Process Center and deploy it directly to these servers while they are online.

Offline Process Servers:

    These servers are defined in the Process Center but are not connected or communicating with it.
    To deploy to these servers, you create a deployment package, transfer it to the target machine, and deploy it using command-line (wsadmin) commands.
